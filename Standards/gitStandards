Standards for git workflow

We will be using a "feature branch workflow"

Rules:
1. Never work on the master branch
2. checkout a new branch when working on a new feature
3. add and commit changes to your feature branch as you work on it
4. when finished with your feature then issue a pull request and merge branch back with master

Example:
Kenny works on a new feature so creates a new branch with a specific name (-b is to create new branch)
	git checkout -b kennys-feature-branch

Kenny works on the branch and makes commits
	git add someFile.txt anotherFile.txt
	git commit -m "added some files"

Kenny repeats the above step until his feature is finished

Kenny then pushes his branch to origin (this can be done as many times as you want while working on the feature)
	git push origin kennys-feature-branch
