Standards for git workflow

We will be using a "feature branch workflow"

Rules:
1. Frequently update your forked clone to the master branch so you are working on the most recent version
2. Never work on the master branch
3. Checkout a new branch when working on a new feature
4. Add and commit changes to your feature branch as you work on it
5. When finished with your feature then issue a pull request and merge branch back with master

Example:
Kenny starts working on a feature for a project he already has cloned

He must first update his version of master
	git checkout master
	git pull

Kenny works on a new feature so he creates a new branch with a specific name (-b is to create new branch)
	git checkout -b kennys-feature-branch

Kenny works on the branch and makes commits
	git add someFile.txt anotherFile.php
	git commit -m "added some files"

Kenny repeats the above step until his feature is finished

Kenny then pushes his branch to origin (this can be done as many times as you want while working on the feature)
	git push origin kennys-feature-branch

Kenny then issues a pull request when completely finished with the feature to merge with the master branch
	This must be done from the github website in a browser
